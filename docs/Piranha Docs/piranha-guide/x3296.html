>        While configuring FOS is a relatively straightforward process, unless
        care is taken it is easy to define a non-functioning cluster, or one
        that "ping-pongs" a failover back and forth between the nodes. This is
        partly because all the services failover as a group, so in order for FOS
        to operate, all services on at least one node in the cluster must come
        up correctly. If one service on node <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>A</I
></TT
> fails
        to come up (due to a configuration error), and a failover occurs, but a
        different service on node <TT
CLASS="REPLACEABLE"
><I
>B</I
></TT
> also fails to
        come up, then the result is a cluster where neither node comes up
        correctly and failover will bounce back and forth.
      </P
><P
>        Before starting Piranha using a newly created or modified configuration
        file, some basic tests should be performed first. These tests should be
        carried out on both nodes in the cluster.

          is that a service's port number (as defined in the cluster configuration

          node.  If this fails, then FOS will also fail. Resolve any problems
          preventing telnet from connecting and it is likely that the

          you will not be able to type it fast enough to prevent the connection
          from timing out and failing to process what you've typed. This does
          not necessarily indicate that there is any problem; just that you
          cannot use <TT
CLASS="APPLICATION"
