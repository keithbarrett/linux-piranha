<h3>What HA service should I use; fos or lvs?</h3>
<p>The answer depends on how your requirements match the service features.
<p><b>FOS</b><p>
Increases fault-tolerance of Linux provided IP services.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Requires 2 linux systems (one active system, one standby system)
<li>Provides automatic failover of IP services, or custom created
services and applications, to the standby system.
<li>No load balancing. No non-linux systems can participate.
<li>Primarily used in infrastructures where just a simple, service
failover setup is needed for increased service reliability or
handling any downtime.
</ul>

<p><b>LVS</b><p>
Provides increased fault-tolerance, and load balancing, of a pool
of Linux and non-Linux servers providing various IP services.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Supports heterogenous systems (i.e. non-linux systems can be
members in the cluster).
<li>Minimally requires 2 linux systems (one active, one standby)
to act as traffic routers, plus one or more service
providing systems (i.e. webservers, ftp servers, etc.).
<li>Number of nodes limited only by the hardware and network used.
<li>Provides load-balancing and improved fault-tolerance
of the service providing systems.
<li>Service providing systems can all be on a private, hidden network and
will appear as a single system and ip address to the public network.
<li>Can be used to automatically map, route, and
failover IP addresses as a means of redirecting services because of
downtime or because the servers are all on a private hidden network.
</ul>

<h3>Do I have to let piranha start/stop the services? Can't I already
have them running on the backup node?</h3>
<p>

Yes you can, and this does have advantages (faster failover, or using the
backup system for other activities).
<p>
If you want, you can have the services already running on the backup system,
and just define useless start and stop commands or fake scripts that do
nothing for that service.
<p>

HOWEVER
<p>
There is a trade-off. Unless you do some special scripting of your own,
you will have a cluster that is only reliable for one failover. A second
failure might require manual intervention.
<p>
Normally, if a failover occurs the backup system becomes active. If the
failed system comes back online and the backup system then has a failure,
it will automatically failover again to the previously failed system.
Piranha helps ensure the services are functional by restarting them.
<p>
In your senerio, the failover to the backup system works the same and is
reliable, but if the original system is online and a failure then occurs
on the backup system, it will attempt failover back to the original system.
Unless you corrected the problem that system may still have non-functioning
services that caused the original failover. You could end up with a
non-functioning cluster at that point, or a ping-pong back and forth.
<p>
Some might call this a double failure and accept the risk, some cannot.
Depends on your business situation.

<h3>Do you support shared-scsi?</h3>
<p>Not at this time. Applications or IP services requiring access to 
a shared database need to have that data NFS mounted from an external
system. That external system can be a fault-tolerant RAID server or
SANs type device to eliminate vulnerabilities.


<p><center><hr></center><p>


<h3>Do you support journal file systems?</h3>
<p>Although they are not yet provided in the product, there is nothing in
the <font color=red>HA Server product</font> that would prevent the use of
the various forms of Linux HA technology (including file systems)
available in the community.
<p>A future release of the <font color=red>HA Server</font> product will
provide support for the installation and use of the Ext3 journaling file
system. The <font color=red>Red Hat HA Team</font> has already announced a
<a href="http://people.redhat.com/kbarrett/HA/news/Ext3_Program.txt">
Beta test program</a> for Ext3.

<p><center><hr></center><p>

<h3>Do you support UDP communications?</h3>
<p>Yes, in piranha releases 0.4.16-3 or later. The 1.0 <font
color=red>High Availability Server</font> product shipped with
piranha 0.4.16-2, so you do need to update to use UDP. Check the software
download area.
<p>Also note that in order to test a UDP service, the service MUST support
responding with a text message after a text message was sent to it. UDP
services cannot be connected to, so a connect-only test is insufficient.

<p><center><hr></center><p>


<h3>How do I incorporate Windows NT (or other OS) into the
cluster?</h3>
<p>The product documentation does not go into this in great
detail. Because Red Hat does not sell Windows NT, Red Hat support
cannot be used to help with questions or problems regarding
its use.
<p>Windows NT, and other OS's, can participate as a Real Server
in an LVS setup, providing IP services such as ftp or http.
In this setup, the server cam be included in the load-balancing
provision of services, but because the server is not Linux, only
round-robbin or number-of-connection based scheduling options will
work. Scheduling based on computer load cannot be used because
Windows NT does not support the rup, uptime, and ruptime
shell commands.
<p>Taking this example further, the 
<font color=red>Red Hat High Availability Server</font>
can be used to
bring low-cost load-balancing or increased fault tolerance to
a pool of Windows NT servers (all on a hidden, private network)
providing web services to a public network and appearing as a single
IP address to the clients
<p>LVS can also be used to remap IP addresses so that client
requests are redirected to a different server. One example of this
would be a Windows NT system that is down, and you want to
redirect all the client connection attempts to a different server
without needing to change the IP address information in your network.
Taken to an extreme, if your whole data center was on a hidden
192.x.x.x private network, with the public IP addresses being mapped
by LVS to the 192 addresses, then you could mix and match those
addresses at will without changing client or WinNT server settings.
Also, with all your servers on 192 addresses, you have more public
IP addresses available for clients.
<p>If you run a Linux cluster with Windows NT servers and would like
to help others, post your information on the lvs mailing list.

<h3>Why do I get a Read I/O timeout error even though I have
no send or expect strings specified?</h3>
<p>You are not using the most current release of the software. You
need to upgrade to at least piranha version 0.4.16-3.
<p>This was original behavior in the product for backwards compatibility
with earlier releases of piranha and was documented.  Basically,
not specifying a send or expect string for an http service caused the
nanny program to use internal defaults.
<p>This behavior has been modified and you should no longer see this
problem. Corrected RPMs have been posted to the software download area.

<p><center><hr></center><p>
<h3>Why does only one of my virtual services start when start piranha?</h3>
<p>There are several situations that can cause this:
<ol>
<li>You are using outdated software. There was a memory leak bug that
has since been fixed which use to manifest itself as a startup problem
sometimes.
<li>You do not have "active = 1" in the service definition. Verify your
your configuration file by running it through the GUI.
<li>The services are using duplicate VIP addresses.
<li>You are trying to define the same VIP address on multiple virtual
interfaces.
<li>You are trying to define multiple VIP addresses on the same virtual
interface.
</ol>


<p><center><hr></center><p>

<h3>Why doesn't the GUI automatically copy the changed configuration file?</h3>
<p>This is planned for a future release. It simply did not make it into
this release in time because the changes require extensive security review.

<p><center><hr></center><p>

<h3>Why is the GUI web based?</h3>
<p>The original piranha GUI used X window, but it soon became
apparent that a web GUI had much more advantages:
<ul>
<li>Almost every client, running any OS, has a web browser that can be used
to configure and manage the cluster.
<li>Windows XX client PCs did not need the added cost of having X server
software like Hummingbird installed, saving client costs.
<li>A web browser enables you to perform the administration tasks from
any client, even from home via the internet, if set up properly.
<li>You can always find the currently "live" Linux router by
referencing the Virtual IP address instead of it's real one.
<li>You can use the same tool (browser) to configure the cluster as
you use to test it's functionality. This includes accessing a
web page during a failure and watching it served by a different system.
<li>Since all the product documentation is online on our web site,
you can read it using the browser.
</ul>


<p><center><hr></center><p>
<h3>Can I use a different web service on Linux than Apache?</h3>
<p>Yes, however the piranha-gui must have apache on the system. Since
the GUI runs as it's own daemon, on a private TCP/IP port,
and with a private configuration file, it will not interfere with other httpd
daemons running on the system providing other services. All that is
needed for the piranha GUI to run is that a program or symbolic
link called "/usr/sbin/piranha.gui" needs to exist -- that is the
program the piranha gui expects to invoke apache. Bringing the piranha
GUI up or down will not affect other web services, and vice versa.

<h3>How does the <font color=red>Red Hat High Availability Server</font> product
differ from <font color=red>Red Hat Linux</font> using piranha?</h3>
<p><b>TECHNOLOGY</b>
<p>The <font color=red>Red Hat High Availability Server</font>
 product is basically  
<font color=red>Red Hat Linux</font>, plus
errata, plus piranha and ipvsadm. Performing a SERVER
installation of the <font color=red>Red Hat Linux</font>
product, and applying the
latest errata, piranha, and ipvsadm
will produce a system that has 100% of the functionality of the
<font color=red>Red Hat High Availability Server</font> product. However because
the HA installer was not involved in this installation process,
there are a few resulting differences:
<p>
<ol>
<li>The system will identify itself as only a Linux release
in the login banner.
<li>Some packages not normally installed by the HA installer
will have been installed. This is harmless, and they can be
removed if desired by performing rpm uninstall commands for
those packages.
<li>The HA installer places a "all:all" in /etc/hosts.deny.
<li>The HA installer places some helpful editing comments in
hosts.allow, hosts.deny, and .rhosts.
<li>The /etc/motd file is set up to identify the system
as "Red Hat High Availability Server".
</ol>
<p>These specific actions can be seen in the "installclass.py"
script in the ha-installer archive in the download area.

<p><b>NON-TECHNOLOGY</b>
<p>The <font color=red>High Availability Server</font> product comes with:
<ul>
<li>A full year of support 
<li>The <font color=red>"Red Hat High Availability Installation Guide"</font>.
A 230+ page hardcopy installation, configuration, and 
trouble-shooting manual. 
<li>Includes Red Hat Linux release, plus piranha and ipvsadm, 
plus all current errata and security patches 
<li>The default installation takes about 1/3rd the time the full Linux 
installation takes. 
</ul>

<p><center><hr></center><p>


<h3>Can I turn my <font color=red>Red Hat linux</font> system
into a <font color=red>Red Hat High Availability Server</font> system?</h3>
<p>Yes you can, however there are some restrictions:
<ol>
<li>Obviously you will will not be able to register it or receive phone
support other that what you are already entitled to as part of your Linux
distribution.
<li>You must be using a compatible version of 
<font color=red>Red Hat Linux</font> (see the <a href="http://ha.redhat.com">
HA Project web site</a> for more information).
<li>Since the product installation software was not used to set up the
system, some packages will have been installed that are normally not there
because they are not required (this is not harmful),
and some of the security changes will not have occurred. Again, this will not
interfere will setting up a running system.
<li>You will not have the <font color=red>High Availability Server
Installation Gude</font>, however it is available online.
</ol>
<p>
The process is basically to install the errata,
and the updated RPMs for the kernel, piranha, and ipvsadm.

<h3>Which packages are not installed by default in the
<font color=red>High Availability Server</font> product installer?
</h3>
<p>
A detailed list of what is and is not installed can be found by
examining the comps-*-ha.in file in the "ha-installer" archive
posted in the download area of the 
<font color=red>Red Hat High Availability Server</font>
web site. In that file,
sections marked with a "0" are not installed by default, unless they are
included in another section that IS being installed.
<p>
<b>Omitted Installation Classes:</b>
<ol>
<li>Printer support (lpr)
<li>X-windows (and Gnome, KDE, Netscape, etc.)
<li>Mail, News, uucp
<li>NFS Server
<li>Network Server (talk-server, rusers-server, rwall-server, finger-server,
tftp-server, ypserv)
<li>Samba
<li>Anonymous ftp Server
<li>Development, Kernel Development, languages, etc.
</ol>
<p>These packages can be individually selected for inclusion if you choose
the "CUSTOM" installation option.
