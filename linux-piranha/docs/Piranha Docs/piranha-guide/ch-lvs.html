>        A Linux Virtual Server (LVS) cluster is a collection of servers that
        have been specially configured to provide highly-available services. The
        diagram below illustrates how an LVS cluster works.

>        An LVS cluster consists of one or two router nodes (top of figure) and a
        variable number of application servers (bottom). We will refer to the
        LVS router nodes as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>LVS routers</I
>, and to the pool
        of application servers as <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>real servers</I
>. Note that
        these terms designate <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>roles</I
> rather than
        machines. For example, the LVS routers shown in <A
HREF="ch-lvs.html#LVS"
>Figure 8-1</A
>
        might be configured to perform both LVS router and real server roles.
      </P
><P
>        Service requests arriving at an LVS cluster are addressed to a
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>virtual server</I
> IP address (sometimes refered to
        as a VIP address). This is a publicly-advertised address that an
        administrator at the site associates with a fully-qualified domain name
        (for example, lvs.ajax.com). The illustration shows only one virtual
        server address, but there may be more than one. The important thing to
        remember is that a VIP address will migrate from one LVS router to the
        other during a failover, thus maintaining a presence at that IP address.
        As such, they can be considered <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>floating</I
>
        addresses. VIP addresses may be aliased to the device (for example,
        <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0:1</TT
>) that connects the LVS routers to the public
        network, or each could be associated with a separate device.
      </P
><P
>        Only one LVS router is active at a time. The role of the
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>active router</I
> is to redirect service requests
        from a virtual server address to the real servers. The redirection is
        based on one of four supported load-balancing algorithms (described in
        <A
HREF="ch-lvs.html#LOAD-BALANCING"
>Table 8-1</A
>). The active router dynamically monitors
        the health of the real servers, and the workload on each, via one of
        three supported methods (described in <A
HREF="x4097.html#NODE-PREREQS"
>Table 8-2</A
>). If
        a real server becomes disabled, the active router stops sending jobs to
        that server until it returns to normal operation.
      </P
><P
>        The backup router performs the role of a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>standy system
        </I
>.  Periodically, the LVS routers exchange "I'm alive"
        heartbeat messages.  Should the backup node fail to receive a heartbeat
        message within an expected interval, it initiates a
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>failover</I
> and assumes the role of the active
        router. During failover, the backup router takes over the VIP
        address(es) serviced by the failed router and uses a technique known as
        <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>ARP spoofing</I
> &#8212; It starts announcing itself
        as the destination for IP packets addressed to the failed node. When the
        failed node returns to service, it assumes the hot backup role.

          set up multiple LVS clusters, you can use different routing methods
          for each cluster.

><P
>          The NAT router IP address is the default route used by each real
          server on the private network to communicate with the active
          router. Like the virtual server address, it is also a floating IP
          address. The NAT router address may be aliased to the device (for
          example, <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth1:1</TT
>) connecting the LVS routers to
          the network of real servers, or associated with a separate device on
          each router.
        </P
><P
>          Also like virtual server addresses, NAT addresses are enabled only on
          the active router. Therefore, should the active router fail, the
          backup router enables the virtual server and NAT addresses during
          take-over of the floating IP addresses. In the topology shown in <A
HREF="ch-lvs.html#NAT"
>Figure 8-2</A
>, virtual server addresses are enabled on device
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0</TT
> and the NAT router address on
          <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth1</TT
>.
        </P
><P
>          As a real server processes a request, it returns packets to the active
          router, where the address of the real server in the packets is
          replaced by the virtual server address. In this manner, the private
          network of real servers is masqueraded from the requesting clients.
        </P
><P
>          NAT routing is easy to set up and flexible. The real servers may be
          any kind of machine running any operating system or Web server, or any
          combination. The chief disadvantage is that, after about twenty real
          servers, the LVS router may become a bottleneck because it must
          process outgoing as well as incoming requests.
        </P
><P
>          <A
HREF="ch-lvs.html#TUNNELING"
>Figure 8-3</A
> illustrates how a tunneling virtual server
          works. With this method, IP encapsulation is enabled on the real
          servers. Prior to assigning a job to a real server, the active router
          encapsulates the IP address of the requesting client inside the real
          server's address.

><P
>          When a real server has processed a job, it returns the response
          directly to the requesting client rather than to the active
          router. Thus, the active router processes incoming requests only. An
          additional advantage of tunneling is that the real servers may be
          geographically distributed. (While IP encapsulation using non-Linux
          real servers may be possible, only Linux real servers have been
          tested in this configuration.)
        </P
><P
>          <A
HREF="ch-lvs.html#DIRECT"
>Figure 8-4</A
> illustrates direct routing. With this method,
          the LVS routers and real servers exist on the same LAN segment. After
          selecting the real server for a job, the active router changes the
          address of the request to that of the real server.

>          When a real server has processed a job, it returns the response
          directly to the requesting client rather than to the active
          router. This method avoids the (admittedly slight) overhead of
          tunneling.

HREF="ch-lvs.html#DNS"
>Figure 8-5</A
> suggests how multiple clusters could be deployed
          in combination with DNS round robin to satisfy the needs of the
          busiest sites. In this scenario, a DNS server resolves service
          requests to multiple virtual server addresses, which a router
          distributes equally among multiple LVS routers. These routers, in
          turn, distribute requests to a shared bank of real servers.

>          Regardless of the routing method, the <I

          table</I

          from a virtual server address to a real server. For example, a TCP
          request addressed to port 80 on virtual server 1.2.3.1 might be routed
          to port 80 on real server 192.168.1.2. The actual mapping of jobs to
          real servers in the IPVS table is based on the load-balancing
          algorithm in use. <A
