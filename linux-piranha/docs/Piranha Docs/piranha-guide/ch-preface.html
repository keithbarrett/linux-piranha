        is a collection of programs that interact with each other to provide a
        clustering solution.  It is vital to note that

> (such as beowulf) uses
            multiple machines to provide greater computing power for
            computationally-intensive tasks.  This type of clustering is not
            addressed by Piranha.

            various technologies to gain an extra level of reliability for a
            service.  HA clustering is the focal point for Piranha.

>        Let's take a look at some sample configurations, using both FOS and LVS
        as the base technology.  Note that the boxes in the following diagrams
        (and the terms used to describe them) designate
        <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>roles</I
> rather than specific systems.  Also keep in
        mind that, due to the variety of ways in which the underlying
        technologies may be deployed, you will find that various terms may be
        used interchangably throughout this and other cluster-related documents.
        Although a cluster may be configured such that each role is carried out
        by a dedicated system, there is no technological requirement for this.
        However, capacity planning or system administration-related issues may
        dictate that dedicated systems be used for the various roles in a given
        cluster.
