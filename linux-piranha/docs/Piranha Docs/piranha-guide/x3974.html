>        An LVS cluster consists of one or two LVS routers and a collection of
        real servers providing Web, FTP, or other services. The connection and
        hardware requirements are described below.
      </P
><P
>        A Linux server that will be the primary LVS router is required. If NAT
        routing is used, this machine needs two network adapters, one connecting
        it to the public network and the other to a private network (where the
        real servers are located). The private network is masqueraded from
        requesting clients. The servers on the private network may be any kind
        of computing platform running any operating system or Web server.
      </P
><P
>        With IP encapsulation, the primary LVS router and real servers may be on
        the same LAN, or the real servers may be geographically dispersed (on a
        WAN). Real servers process requests directed to them and return
        responses directly to requesting clients.
      </P
><P
>        With direct routing, the primary LVS router and real servers are on the
        same LAN segment. As with IP encapsulation, real servers return
        processed requests directly to requesting clients.
      </P
><P
>        If you want failover capability, a second Linux server that will be the
        backup LVS router is required. This machine, a hot standby, needs to be
        configured exactly like the primary LVS router. For example, with NAT
        routing, the backup LVS router also needs two network adapters
        connecting it to the public network and to the private network of real
        servers. The adapter devices must match on the two LVS routers. Thus, if
        devices <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth0</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="FILENAME"
>eth1</TT
> on the
        primary LVS router connect it to public and private network,
        respectively, then these same devices on the backup LVS router must
        connect it to the public and private network.
      </P
><P
>        During configuration, you assign a <I
CLASS="FIRSTTERM"
>weight</I
> to each
        real server. This is an integer reflecting each server's processing
        capacity (based on memory, processor speed, number of processors, etc.)
        relative to that of the others. It is the ratio between each server's
        weights that are significant.  For example, if the weights of two
        servers are 2/1, 20/10, or 200/100, the result is the same &#8212; the
        first server has twice the capacity of the second.  However, note that
        finer adjustments are possible if larger weights are used.  The assigned
        weight, which may be dynamically adjusted based on load information, is
        used by two of the available job scheduling algorithms (described in
        <A
HREF="ch-lvs.html#LOAD-BALANCING"
>Table 8-1</A
>). You should be prepared to assign
        accurate weights.
